              <p>Summary: Our heros started on their 7-day ride to Astos, and along their journey Julian Delfici began having dreams of a small child falling to earth in a sort of meteor. Julian also witnessed the boy being carried off by orcs. The party found their way to the city of Elton, and met a man named Burton Smith the Blacksmith. Burton told them of a boy named Arithel that he found and took in that was recently kidnapped in the recent orc raid. The Party agreed to help the town by returning the boy and banishing Brash the lesser and his band of orcs from this town. The party cleared the hideout with several tries and one almost death which was salvaged by the flask given to them by the local priest. Upon the second attempt the party downs Brash the Lesser and frees Arithel. However Brash, possessing the powers of darkness, regenerates and escapes to wreak havoc another day. Upon freeing Arithel, the party finds that he is an archon, and his keeper Michal appears, and takes Arithel back to their plane. Before leaving Michal grants them a power from Arithel’s wings in order to contact Arithel and Michal. The group also found 2 vials of angel blood, and angel tears upon searching of Brash’s things. They then met with Tholomon and were spirited away to Astos by the wings of an Archon.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="blog_body">
              <p>
Summary: Upon arriving in Astos our party found out about the two warring families the Arroway and the Urthadar. Both Families are fighting over the recently vacant throne. The Party visits the throne room in order to find out if there is any work while they wait for Tholoman. They Priest of Pelor is currently presiding over things while the throne is vacant. He points them to the kings guard for more information. The Guard tells them of people going missing near the mages guild and an eerie silence from a nearby mining keep. The group sets off toward Brightstone Keep. On the way there, a BreathDrinker targets Brad Hatherby in his sleep and causes some commotion. After a rough night, they arrive at the keep to find a semi friendly wolf, two trolls, several dozen orcs, and some mine workers held hostage. Battle and multiple sleeping murders happen. The adventurers also manage to ambush the orc squad returning the second group of miners to their cells. Then the party explores the mines to find that kurashh the Necromancer has created an undead army. Battle ensues and our heros triumph even if Paxton nearly died again. They then collected the spoils and returned to Astos. While there Julian was made Lord of BrightStone, and Paxton his chief mage. Julian also hired a manager to oversee the rebuilding of the keep as well as the construction of the Mage’s Tower for Paxton. The Wolf also remind in the keep, as a sort of guardian.
