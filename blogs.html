              <h3> Dance Floor Psychology </h3>
            </div>
            <div class="blog_body">
              <p>
                So as some may know and others may not, I dabble in the Dj'ing business. I have one recurring gig that I come back to every year. The Prom and or Homecoming of my old Alma Mater. So the topic of this blog post is dance floor psychology, just to preface this with the most “psychology” experience I have is one semester in college, and it was an 8 a.m. class so we all know how that goes.
              </p>

              <p>
                So let’s set the stage about what I observed. The two dances in question happened 1 year apart from one another, they were held at different locations, with a different choice of students even though some of them overlapped. The one dance was held at a hotel or event center in a room named after some type of tree, Maple or Oakleaf. That venue's dance floor that was roughly the size of freshman college dorm room, including the awkward budding into adulthood smell that comes with it. The venue this year was in a large industrial barn-like building.The dance floor, roughly the size of a football field. Keep in mind this was the same amount of students as before, 120 students.
              </p>

              <p>
                The observation, in the smaller venue every kid got on that dance floor even tho it was jam-packed and packed full of preteen hormones and sweat. The kids danced all night and it was probably the best event we have thrown. This year however the kids were very reluctant to dance and when they finally came out to the dance floor it was a struggle to keep them there.
              </p>

              <p>
                My theory, is that the kids being roughly between the age of 16 - 19 are still struggling with their self-confidence and self-image. The fact that they could blend into a crowd and feed off each other’s energy.The students were among their peers and move collectively not worrying about the typical status or ranks of high school. However, this year, with the dance floor so large and open most of the kids stayed in their respective cliques and didn’t cut loose or open up to the music as well.
              </p>

              <p>
                In summary, none of this really means much just something very interesting that I noticed in life. I’m sure that this could be applied to business, market trends, or something else in a deep profound way but… I am not knowledgeable enough in those areas to confidently make any assumptions. So for now just take it as I write it I guess. I’m just a guy making observations in life, and attempting to write about them.
